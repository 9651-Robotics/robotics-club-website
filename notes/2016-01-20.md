# Robotics - January 20th (BSS Meeting)
## Bot Options
### Option 1: Working Arm
#### Arm in Working State:
* Scrap it
#### Extending Arm Length:
* Tough to implement, even with unlimited time
* Requires power behind rotational mechanisms
* Possible telescopic arm (time-constraints)
* Another joint (material and torque constraints, as well as time)
#### General Notes:
* Stopper for arm

### Option 2: Ramp
* High Chance of implementing quickly
* Plexiglass/metal hybrid
* Make top of robot flat; deployable Ramp
* Account that bots can only drive up a 20 degree angle
