## Notes
* If you are making functionality changes to the site, and aren't either Matt or Jack Sarick, please either create a fork of the repo, or make a branch. Then, make a pull request, and we will approve (or reject) your changes.
* Please stay professional. This isn't a company, but refrain from inappropriate comments, terrible grammar on site content, and conversational etiquette.
* Organize! If you can, try to modularise your files, especially if they're often called on.
