**This code is slated for a rework this year on a [new repository](https://github.com/9651-Robotics/website)**, when the club heads/designers have time. We'll be condensing the website, reducing clutter, and fixing many bad coding practices. Until then, we don't suggest adding new features on this broken code. In addition, content won't be fully up to date as we figure out the changes we're making. Thanks for being patient!
