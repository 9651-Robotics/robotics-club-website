# Contributing Do's and Don'ts
Hey there! You're probably on this page since you're looking to contribute to the Robotics Club Website, and we welcome you with open arms! Here's just a few tips on what you should do:

## DO
* Comment your code and make it easy to understand (this is very hard, but if you can that'd be awesome!)
* Be relatively descriptive in your commit messages, though they can be derivative of previous messages.
* Follow our issue template when submitting issues.
* Use GitHub effectively to manage files (branches, forks, etc.)
* Ask for help when you need it!

## DON'T
* Use different variable naming systems (e.g. variable_name, VARIABLENAME, variable-name) (normally we use variable_name)
* Repeat code or use redundant/inefficient code when possible: use functions or look things up!
* Use offensive or derogatory language in either comments, function/variable names, or anything really.
* Make big changes in the master branch; use a fork or make a new branch.
* Make big functionality changes without notifying members of the dev team.
